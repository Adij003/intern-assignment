Here we'll add how to run the web server, adding .env file and installing npm package

to run the projet, first we need to install packages via npm i and  create a .env file

and then post on the route "http://localhost:5000/api/users" to register a user along while adding data in body:  name, email and password

the first step is to create a user... we use '/api/users' to register the user, and req obtains the data recieved from postman or frontend
we also generate a jwt as soon as we register a user or we login
